                        <p>The activity concerns the production of content (news reports, activity reports, in-depth analysis on current or study topics, interviews with personalities from the world of culture, work, the national and international star set, politics) to be published and disseminate on the institute web radio “Radio ITIGEO”.
                            The students will animate a journalistic editorial team and write the articles, which they will then record in the radio studios, processing them using specific audio software (audacity) and publishing them on the reference site.
                            Live broadcasts allow teachers and students a creative and interactive approach with the users who participate in the broadcasts. After a long period of planning the episode, the broadcast will require advertising and dissemination activities, voice-over and technical direction.
                            The project aims to improve students' written and oral production, to develop a sense of active and aware citizenship and to increase the sense of belonging to the school.
                            The radio is also a useful tool for connecting students with the working reality of our territory, a bridge for orientation towards the world of work, according to the ministerial indications of Scuola Futura. A particular advantage of this extraordinary means of communication is its inclusiveness. Many of the protagonists, including speakers and technical directors, are children with specific learning disabilities who develop and enhance their written and oral skills.</p>

                        <p>This, shown alongside, is this year's radio venue which has had dramatic improvements, including absorbent foam panels on the walls. Here our episodes are broadcast, managed by us students with the help of the teachers. The venue has many defects, but this is normal for an institute radio. However, the feeling of being here, both to broadcast something you wrote and thought of, and to be behind the control room managing microphones and audio, is a wonderful emotion. Even if it is not appreciated enough among students, among school projects I consider it one of the best.</p>
