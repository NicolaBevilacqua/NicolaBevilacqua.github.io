        <h3>The Primordial Chaos</h3>
        <p>At the beginning of time, according to Greek mythology, there existed only Chaos, a primordial void without form. From Chaos emerged various primordial entities: Gaia (the Earth), Tartarus (the deep underworld), Eros (love and life force), Erebus (darkness), and Nyx (night).</p>

        <h3>The Birth of Zeus and the Gods' Rebellion</h3>
        <p>When Rhea bore her sixth child, Zeus, she hid him on the island of Crete and deceived Cronus by giving him a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes. Zeus grew up in secret and, once grown, forced Cronus to vomit up his siblings. Together, the rebellious gods declared war on Cronus and the Titans, a war known as the Titanomachy.</p>
