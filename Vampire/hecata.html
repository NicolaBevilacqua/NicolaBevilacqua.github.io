							<h4>You feel it, don’t you? Just like all Kindred, you died and came back. But when you died, your soul resisted a little longer than that of your neighbor. You felt the pull of Oblivion, and it fucked you up. You struggled with the return to the mortal shell and you’re not sure you’re happy to be back. You’re less and more than all your undead kin. You already understand what it is to be dead, to experience the end, to know the fear of the great nothingness. Welcome to the family.
							You’re one of us. You’re my cousin, his sister, and her daughter. We’re connected not only by blood, and by vitae, but by that first-hand knowledge of death. Consider yourself awake now? When you died, you nearly stayed dead and you’re terrified. But I bet you’re turned on by the thrill of it too.
							Fuck them.
							This is a time of great change, mother. Our family is larger now. No less dysfunctional, but larger. Safety in numbers becomes important when the Camarilla say, «You’re with us or against us, but you? You can never be with us.» Safety in numbers becomes important when vampire killers are looking for companies, properties, and accounts made in the name of some dead Giovanni or
							Dunsirn. The family comes together to outlast the winter storm.
							But just as the seasons change, death has many faces, as our cousins always say.
							Venetians, pocket your distrust for the Samedi, and recognize that death, no matter the mask it wears, is still death.

											their own interests. The family must

							without supernatural means or solved

							When drinking directly from a

							Unwilling mortals not restrained will
							try to escape, and even those coerced
							or willing must succeed in a Stamina
