							Even the dim light of the stars feels like a fading hope, devoured by the black. There is nothing.
							Nothing but you.
							Now that you’re one of us, you realize you are the center of it all. Our elders believe we can only grow in strength through enlightened self-interest and preying on the weak. The weak will always be prey, so it is far better that their predators are competent enough to handle them with grace.
							You will find yourself clad in the trappings of religion. We promise those who serve us a place in heaven, a bounty when they slay our enemies: a glorious cocktail of dogmatic faith and absolute nihilism.
							Does this make us evil? No. Don’t be silly. The concept of evil is something on which elders sell their ignorant childer. We Lasombra are the only ones awake.							</h4>

											<p>Lasombra sires favor mortals who fit the mold of
											the clan. The Lasombra have been of a Darwinian philosophy since before the term existed. They have no time
											for weakness, feel the only way to survive is to excel, and
											cut away the trappings of sympathy and petty morality
											wherever it might slow down their ascent to power.
											The Lasombra Embrace those who fight against the
											odds, survive dangerous situations, and exist at the pinnacle of excellence. The Magisters describe their Embrace
											tradition as “targeting those fit for more than a simple
											human life.” Sociopaths, counter-culturalists, deviants, and
											scarred survivors all hold appeal for the Lasombra. Anyone
											who can say they have seen the dark on the other side, and
											subsequently came back stronger, is a potential candidate
											for the Embrace. Many become vampires obsessed with
											the accumulation of social power, prepared to mislead and
											use mortals to elevate themselves. Others were like that
											before the Embrace, with such pragmatic traits leading to
											their ascent in Lasombra eyes.
											The Lasombra lean heavily into the institutions
											of organized religion to find their prospective childer.
											They do not look for the truly faithful, or the truly 
											depraved, but the priests who gained their role through
											a desire to have complete control over the spiritual
											destination of their congregations. Those nuns, monks,
											vicars, and rabbis who use their institutions as a tool to
											increase their power, often shaking hands with gangsters behind closed doors, are the kind of cold-hearted
											bastards Magisters adore.
											The mortals Embraced into this clan surprise those
											who underestimate their ability, rising to positions of
											power in Camarilla cities more swiftly than anyone can
											predict.

							crush wills and command obedience without the
							unnecessary pretense of the Ventrue and Toreador.
							The callous way in which they exert this Discipline
							on victims earns antipathy from the other clans,

							ombra uses Dominate to tell a victim to bare their

						<div class="col" style="border-right: 3px solid grey">
							<h5>Oblivion:</h5>

							as a weapon or tool. This power, envied by some
							Kindred, loathed by most, is the Lasombra’s great
							-
							est strength and deepest weakness. Lasombra may
							use shadows to attack a foe, intimidate a victim
							with a cloak of darkness, or pass into one shadow
							and exit another to evade observation. Many claim
							there’s a cost to one’s soul for using Oblivion, or
							that it draws the eyes of the clan founder.</p>
						</div>

							<h5>Potence:</h5>
							<p>This power enables a vampire to hit
							unnaturally hard, lift with an inhuman strength,
							and bound across impressive distances. Few
							Lasombra use Potence for the purpose of assisting their
							feeding, considering it a vulgar exercise to manually grab
							and hold a vessel. The clan’s members favor popping an
							enemy’s skull with their hands, driving a boot through
							a punk’s stomach, or ripping a door off a hinge to command respect and fear in other circumstances, however.</p>

							<h4>Lasombra: Ruthlessness</h4>
							<h5>To the Lasombra, failure is not an option. Their

							lasting centuries. Any setback is felt profoundly and
							they quickly escalate to the most ruthless of methods
							until they achieve their aims.

							<h4>Bane</h4>
							<h5>Anyone seeing the reflection or recording (live and

							they’re looking for. People with no prior knowledge
							will know something is wrong, but likely attribute the
							distortion to irregularities in the reflecting surface or
							recording errors. Note that this will not hide the identity of the vampire with any certainty, and the Lasombra
							are no less likely to be caught on surveillance than any
							other vampire. In addition, use of modern communication technology, including making a simple phone call,
							requires a Technology test at Difficulty 2 + Bane Severity
							as microphones have similar problems with the voice
							of a Lasombra as cameras with their image. Avoiding
							electronic vampire detection systems is also done at a
							penalty equal to Bane Severity </h5>
