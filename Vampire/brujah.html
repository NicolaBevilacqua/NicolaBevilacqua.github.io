											<p>The Brujah clan has always embraced those who show solidarity with the counterculture and revolution.
											It seeks allies who question normative ideas and, recognising the fire that ignites the oppressed, tends to gravitate towards the underdog.
											Even if the clan includes a not insignificant number of rowdy and all too visible outcasts,
											the desire for rebellion also lurks deeply in the conman who cheats his own company,
											in the lawyer who represents the poor pro bono, in the neo-Nazi who claims to belong to the 'alternative right'
											and in the basement tenant who downloads thousands of pirated films for redistribution on streaming sites.
											Brujahs can be passionate fighters, but also critical thinkers; the clan's activists are often very different from its theorists.
											On many occasions, the latter are embraced by former gender studies or sociology students,
											among those who have survived near-death experiences and individuals who have otherwise suffered severe personal losses.</p>
